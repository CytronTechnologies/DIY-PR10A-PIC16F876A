# Controlling DC Brush Motor Using MD10C
Sample source code for DIY PR10A. Project description : PR10 is an open source microcontroller Do It Yourself kit. This PIC microcontroller based project uses PIC16F876A to interface with MD10C to control a DC geared motor. It exposes the technique to interface motor driver and configure PWM for speed control. 4 push button offer control of speed increase, decrease, run/changing direction and brake. Compatible with MPLAB IDE with HITECH C compiler, MPLABX with HITECH C compiler v9.83/v9.82/v9.80 and XC8 compiler.

There is 3 folder which are Source code(.c), Sample code using MPLABX and sample code using MPLAB(Using MPLAB 8.6 And HiTech 9.80) Welcome to our tecnical forum for any inquiry. http://forum.cytron.com.my/
